## Introduction

This project is about sorting data on a stack with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. It aims to teach students about how to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

There are two stacks `a` and `b`. At the begginning, stack `a` contains the numbers to be sorted and stack `b` is empty. Only eleven stack operations are allowed. All of them are listed below:

| Abbreviation | Operation | Description |
|:------|:------|:------|
| `sa` | swap a |  |
| `sb` | swap b |  |
| `ss` | swap both |  |
| `pa` | push a |  |
| `pb` | push b |  |
| `ra` | rotate a |  |
| `rb` | rotate b |  |
| `rr` | rotate both | `ra`and `rb`at the same time.  |
| `rra` | reverse rotate a |  |
| `rrb` | reverse rotate b |  |
| `rrr` | reverse rotate both |  |
